            <h2>The Genrefication Project Begins!</h2>
            <p class="post-date">Posted on June 10, 2025</p>
            <p>The transformation of the GCMS library began with a moment of pure nostalgia. I pulled a random book from the shelves, a 1989 edition, complete with its original, ink-stamped checkout card. Seeing the history of that single book, I knew I had a significant project ahead of me. It was clear the collection had not been weeded in some time, leaving a large number of aged books.
My suspicions were confirmed by a Follett Titlewave analysis, which revealed the average age of our collection is over twenty years. The analysis broke this down by Dewey categories, showing that while our non-fiction was more dated, our students were gravitating towards fiction. This made it clear: revitalizing the fiction section was the priority.
Drawing on my EKU studies and discussions with other district librarians, I knew genrefication was the answer. It's a system already used in our district's e-libraries, so this change will create consistency for our students. By organizing our collection by genre, we can empower students to find the books they love and discover new ones. With this goal in mind, I've started a to-do list to guide the library's much-needed transformation.

            <h2>Weeding The Collection</h2>
            <p class="post-date">Posted on June 17, 2025</p>
            <p>Phase one of the library improvement is in full swing! Today, I'm methodically working my way through the stacks, pulling the five most aged or damaged books from each shelf. The immediate goal is to condense the collection to a more manageable size.
I had a chat with our district's high school librarian, who confirmed we're on the right track. He mentioned that 20,000 items is a significant number for 700 students, especially since that count includes things like curriculum sets and lost items, bringing our actual book count closer to 12,000.
It'll take about a week to get all these weeded books removed from the Follett system. Once that's done, I'll contact our Follett rep for a genre analysis of the new, leaner collection. Next up after that: ordering new labels and mapping out where each genre will live in our transformed library. Stay tuned for more updates!
